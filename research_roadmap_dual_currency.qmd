# Project Overview

## Title (Working)

**"Credit Risk and Dollarization in Cambodia: A Dual-Currency Analysis Using Interest Rate Spreads (2014–2024)"**

## Research Questions

1. How do credit risk dynamics differ between USD and KHR lending in Cambodia's banking sector?
2. Which currency segment is more sensitive to financial shocks, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic?
3. Can a composite dual-currency Credit Risk Index serve as an effective early warning tool for monitoring financial stability?

## Why This Topic Is Strong

- **Original**: No existing study applies a dual-currency CRI framework to Cambodia
- **Policy-relevant**: Cambodia is actively pursuing de-dollarization — your results speak directly to whether that changes the risk profile
- **Data-feasible**: Uses only publicly available NBC interest rate data (no loan-level data needed)
- **Technically impressive**: Stochastic modeling, comparative analysis, stress testing
- **Interview-ready**: Shows you understand Cambodia's unique banking landscape deeply

## The Big Idea in One Paragraph

Cambodia's banking sector is unique because it operates in two currencies simultaneously — roughly 80% of lending is in USD and 20% in KHR. This means credit risk may behave very differently depending on which currency a loan is denominated in. By modeling the interest rate spread (loan rate minus deposit rate) separately for each currency using a mean-reverting stochastic process, you can construct currency-specific Credit Risk Indices and a system-wide composite index. Comparing how these indices behave — especially during the COVID-19 shock — reveals whether dollarization amplifies or dampens credit risk, and which segment serves as a better early warning signal.

# Paper Structure

Aim for **18–28 pages** total.

## Section 1: Introduction (2–3 pages)

### What to Write

Open with the significance of credit risk in banking, then narrow to Cambodia's specific context. The key tension: Cambodia has a *dual-currency* banking system, and we don't know whether credit risk behaves the same way in both segments.

### Key Arguments to Make

**Cambodia's banking sector context:**

- Rapid credit growth over the past decade (often 15–25% annually)
- Banking assets have grown to over 180% of GDP
- The sector is a critical engine of economic growth but also a potential source of systemic risk

**The dollarization challenge:**

- Cambodia is one of the most dollarized economies in the world
- Approximately 80% of loans and deposits are in USD
- The NBC has been gradually pushing de-dollarization (higher reserve requirements for USD, promoting KHR use)
- USD and KHR lending carry different risk profiles: KHR loans face additional exchange rate risk, while USD loans create systemic vulnerability to external dollar shocks

**The data gap:**

- Granular loan-level default data is not widely available in Cambodia
- Traditional credit risk models (PD, LGD, EAD) require this data
- Interest rate spreads offer an indirect but powerful alternative — banks embed their risk assessment into the rates they charge

**Your contribution:**

- First study to construct a dual-currency Credit Risk Index for Cambodia
- Uses only publicly available data from NBC
- Provides a practical early warning tool
- COVID-19 serves as a natural stress event to validate the framework

### How to End the Introduction

State your three research questions clearly, then provide a brief roadmap of the paper's structure.

## Section 2: Literature Review (3–4 pages)

Organize into four themes:

### 2.1 Credit Risk Measurement

Briefly explain the standard approach: banks measure credit risk through three components — Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Together these determine expected credit losses. Mention that this framework requires loan-level data with observed defaults, which is a constraint in emerging markets.

Reference your study materials on how banks segment portfolios by product type and client type, and build separate models for different segments — this directly supports your decision to model USD and KHR separately.

### 2.2 Interest Rate Spreads as Risk Indicators

This is the theoretical foundation. Cover:

- The TED spread (Treasury-Eurodollar spread) as a well-known systemic risk indicator
- Corporate bond spreads as credit risk measures
- Studies using bank-level spreads to assess financial health
- The logic: spreads capture credit risk, operating costs, and profit margin, but changes in spreads over time primarily reflect changes in perceived risk

### 2.3 Stochastic Models in Finance

Introduce the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and why mean-reverting models are appropriate for interest rate spreads. Key references:

- Vasicek (1977) — one of the earliest mean-reverting interest rate models
- Literature on stochastic modeling of credit spreads

### 2.4 Cambodia's Financial System and Dollarization

- Overview of Cambodia's banking sector development
- Studies on dollarization in Cambodia (Menon 2008, Duma 2011, or more recent IMF reports)
- NBC's de-dollarization efforts and their impact
- Any existing studies on financial stability or credit risk in Cambodia

### 2.5 Gap in Literature

No study has: (a) applied the CRI framework to Cambodia, (b) compared credit risk dynamics across USD and KHR segments, or (c) used Cambodia's interest rate spreads to construct an early warning indicator.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Literature Review Strategy
Search Google Scholar for: "interest rate spread credit risk", "dollarization Cambodia banking", "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck credit spread", "financial stability early warning indicator", "Cambodia banking sector risk". Aim for 15–25 references.
:::

## Section 3: Methodology (5–6 pages)

### 3.1 Interest Rate Spread Definition

For each currency $c \in \{USD, KHR\}$:

$$
S_t^c = r_{\text{loan},t}^c - r_{\text{deposit},t}^c
$$

This gives you two time series: $S_t^{USD}$ and $S_t^{KHR}$.

**Why model them separately**: Risk factors differ across segments, so models should be built separately. USD lending is influenced by global dollar conditions and Fed policy, while KHR lending is more sensitive to domestic monetary policy and exchange rate movements.

### 3.2 The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model

For each currency $c$, the spread follows:

$$
dS_t^c = \kappa^c(\theta^c - S_t^c)\,dt + \sigma^c\,dW_t^c
$$

| Parameter | Meaning | What to Compare Across Currencies |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------|
| $\theta^c$ | Long-run average spread | Is the "normal" spread higher for KHR or USD? |
| $\kappa^c$ | Speed of mean reversion | Does one currency recover faster from shocks? |
| $\sigma^c$ | Volatility | Which currency has more volatile spreads? |

The spread at time $t$ follows a normal distribution:

$$
S_t^c \sim \mathcal{N}\left(m^c(t),\; v^c(t)\right)
$$

where:

$$
m^c(t) = \theta^c + (S_0^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c t}
$$

$$
v^c(t) = \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}\left(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c t}\right)
$$

### 3.3 Parameter Estimation

For discrete monthly observations, the transition density between consecutive observations:

$$
S_{t_{i+1}}^c \mid S_{t_i}^c \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\theta^c + (S_{t_i}^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t},\; \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})\right)
$$

The **log-likelihood function**:

$$
\ell(\kappa^c, \theta^c, \sigma^c) = -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln\left(\frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})\right) - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(S_{t_i}^c - \theta^c - (S_{t_{i-1}}^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t}\right)^2}{2 \cdot \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})}
$$

Maximize using `scipy.optimize.minimize` (with negative log-likelihood).

::: {.callout-note}
## Cross-Check with AR(1)
The OU process in discrete time is equivalent to an AR(1) model:

$$S_{t+1}^c = a^c + b^c S_t^c + \varepsilon_t^c$$

where $b^c = e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t}$, $a^c = \theta^c(1 - b^c)$, and $\text{Var}(\varepsilon^c) = \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - (b^c)^2)$.

Run a simple OLS regression of $S_{t+1}$ on $S_t$ and back out the OU parameters as verification.
:::

### 3.4 Crisis Threshold

For each currency, use the **95th percentile** of historical spreads:

$$
S_c^{USD} = \text{Percentile}_{95}(S_t^{USD}), \qquad S_c^{KHR} = \text{Percentile}_{95}(S_t^{KHR})
$$

Sensitivity analysis with the 90th and 99th percentiles.

::: {.callout-important}
## Important
Each currency gets its own threshold because their "normal" spread levels are different. KHR spreads are typically wider than USD spreads.
:::

### 3.5 Crisis Probability

$$
P(S_t^c > S_c^c) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{S_c^c - m^c(t)}{\sqrt{v^c(t)}}\right)
$$

### 3.6 Currency-Specific Credit Risk Indices

$$
\text{CRI}^c = \alpha \cdot \sigma^c + \beta \cdot P(S_t^c > S_c^c)
$$

Use $\alpha = \beta = 0.5$ as baseline.

### 3.7 System-Wide Composite CRI

$$
\text{CRI}_{\text{System}} = w_{USD} \cdot \text{CRI}^{USD} + w_{KHR} \cdot \text{CRI}^{KHR}
$$

| Weighting Approach | $w_{USD}$ | $w_{KHR}$ | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Loan-share weighted | ~0.80 | ~0.20 | Reflects actual banking system composition |
| Equal weighted | 0.50 | 0.50 | Gives equal attention to both segments |
| Time-varying | Changes yearly | Changes yearly | Captures de-dollarization trend |

### 3.8 Stress Testing

$$
S_t^{c,\text{stress}} = S_t^c(1 + \delta)
$$

| Scenario | $\delta$ | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Mild | 0.10 | Minor economic slowdown |
| Moderate | 0.30 | Significant financial stress |
| Severe | 0.50 | Major crisis |

Recompute all three CRIs under each scenario.

### 3.9 COVID-19 Sub-Period Analysis

| Period | Dates | Label |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Pre-COVID | 2014 – Dec 2019 | Baseline |
| COVID | Jan 2020 – Dec 2021 | Shock |
| Post-COVID | Jan 2022 – 2024 | Recovery |

Estimate OU parameters and CRI separately for each sub-period, for each currency.

## Section 6: Discussion (2–3 pages)

### Key Discussion Points

- **Dollarization and risk**: Does the USD segment stabilize or amplify systemic risk?
- **COVID-19 impact**: Was the shock temporary or structural?
- **Early warning value**: Did the CRI signal risk before the crisis became obvious?
- **Policy implications**: What does this mean for NBC's de-dollarization agenda?
- **Limitations**: Spreads capture more than credit risk; aggregate data; model assumptions; limited validation without default data

## Section 7: Conclusion (1 page)

Summarize key findings, practical value of the dual-currency CRI as a monitoring tool, and future research directions.

# Interview Preparation

## The 60-Second Pitch

> "I built a dual-currency Credit Risk Index for Cambodia's banking sector. Cambodia is heavily dollarized — about 80% of lending is in US dollars — so I wanted to understand whether credit risk behaves differently in the dollar segment versus the riel segment. I used 10 years of interest rate data from the National Bank of Cambodia and modeled the lending-deposit spread for each currency using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process. From that, I estimated crisis probabilities and constructed a composite Credit Risk Index. I also ran stress tests and used COVID-19 as a case study. The framework gives regulators and banks a practical early warning tool that works without needing loan-level default data."

## Likely Follow-Up Questions

**"Why did you use interest rate spreads instead of default data?"**
> Cambodia doesn't have widely available loan-level default data. The spread approach captures how banks price risk in real time using only publicly available data.

**"What's the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model?"**
> A mean-reverting stochastic process — it captures the idea that spreads return to a normal level over time. Three intuitive parameters: long-run average, speed of reversion, and volatility.

**"What were your main findings?"**
> [Depends on results — frame as a story about USD vs. KHR risk dynamics]

**"What are the limitations?"**
> Spreads capture more than credit risk (also operating costs and margins). Working with aggregate market rates, not individual bank data. Model assumes normally distributed shocks.

2. **Install Anaconda** (comes with everything you need)
3. **Plot both spreads** in Jupyter — see if they move together or differently
4. **Find USD/KHR lending shares** from any NBC annual report (for system CRI weights)
5. **Come back** when ready to code — I will help you build each notebook step by step
