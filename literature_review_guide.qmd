# First: Is Your Methodology Legitimate?

**Yes. Here's the proof.**

You might feel unsure because this is your first research project, but your methodology is built on extremely well-established foundations. Let me show you exactly where each piece comes from:

| What You're Doing | Established By | Year | Used By |
|-------------------|---------------|------|---------|
| Mean-reverting model for interest rates | Vasicek, O. "An Equilibrium Characterization of the Term Structure" — *Journal of Financial Economics* | 1977 | Every major bank and central bank in the world |
| The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process | Uhlenbeck & Ornstein (physics), adapted to finance by Vasicek | 1930 / 1977 | Standard in quantitative finance textbooks |
| Interest rate spreads as risk indicators | TED spread, corporate bond spreads — used by the Fed, ECB, IMF | Decades | Central banks globally use spreads to monitor financial stability |
| MLE for OU parameter estimation | Standard statistical method | — | Every quantitative finance program teaches this |
| Composite risk indices | IMF Financial Soundness Indicators, various central bank indices | — | IMF, World Bank, BIS regularly publish composite risk measures |
| Stress testing | Basel Committee on Banking Supervision | 2004+ | Required by regulation for every major bank |

**You are not inventing a new method.** You are applying well-proven tools to a context (Cambodia's dual-currency system) where they haven't been applied before. That's exactly what good applied research looks like.

The specific combination — using spreads + OU model + CRI + dual-currency comparison — is original in its application to Cambodia, but every individual component is mainstream finance.

# Your Reference List (Organized by Section)

Here are the actual papers and documents you should cite. I've organized them by which section of your literature review they support.

## Section 2.1: Credit Risk Measurement (PD, LGD, EAD)

These establish that the standard approach requires loan-level data, which motivates your alternative approach.

### Key References

- Search: `IFRS 9 expected credit loss standard`

### What to Write (2.1)

In 3–4 paragraphs, explain:

1. Banks measure credit risk using PD, LGD, and EAD, which together determine expected credit loss (cite [1])
2. These models require historical loan-level data with observed default events (cite [2], [3])
3. Regulatory frameworks like Basel II and IFRS 9 mandate this type of modeling (cite [1], [4])
4. In emerging markets like Cambodia, granular default data is often unavailable, creating a need for alternative approaches → this motivates your paper

## Section 2.2: Interest Rate Spreads as Risk Indicators

This is your theoretical foundation — the idea that the gap between loan and deposit rates captures credit risk.

- Search Google Scholar: `Drehmann Juselius 2014 early warning indicators banking crises`

### What to Write (2.2)

In 3–4 paragraphs, explain:

1. The interest rate spread (loan rate minus deposit rate) is a fundamental concept in banking — it compensates banks for credit risk, operating costs, and profit margin (cite [5])
2. Research has shown empirically that spreads widen when default risk increases (cite [6], [7])
3. Credit spreads are widely used as early warning indicators for financial stress — central banks and the IMF monitor them regularly (cite [8])
4. Therefore, tracking how spreads evolve over time captures banks' real-time risk assessment, even without default data → this is the core insight of your paper

## Section 2.3: Stochastic Models in Finance (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck / Vasicek)

This legitimizes your modeling choice.

### Key References

"An Equilibrium Characterization of the Term Structure"
*Journal of Financial Economics*, 5(2), 177-188.
*→ THE original paper. Introduced the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to finance for modeling interest rates. Your model is a direct application of this.*

### What to Write (2.3)

In 2–3 paragraphs, explain:

1. Interest rate spreads don't wander randomly — they tend to revert to a long-run "normal" level. This is called mean reversion. (Intuition: competitive forces and monetary policy pull spreads back to equilibrium)
2. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, introduced to finance by Vasicek (1977), is the standard model for mean-reverting financial variables (cite [9], [12])
3. The OU model has three intuitive parameters: long-run mean ($\theta$), speed of reversion ($\kappa$), and volatility ($\sigma$). It can be estimated from data using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and has a known closed-form distribution, which makes computing crisis probabilities straightforward (cite [9], [11])
4. While extensions exist (e.g., the CIR model [10] which prevents negative values), the Vasicek/OU framework is sufficient for your application because interest rate spreads are positive by nature in your data

This grounds your study in the specific country context.

### What to Write (2.4)

In 3–4 paragraphs, explain:

1. Cambodia became heavily dollarized in the early 1990s following post-conflict inflows (cite [13], [14])
2. Today, approximately 80% of bank lending is in USD, making Cambodia one of the most dollarized economies globally (cite [13], [18])
3. The NBC has been pursuing de-dollarization through higher reserve requirements for USD and promotion of KHR use (cite [17], [18], [19])
4. High dollarization creates specific financial stability risks: limited monetary policy independence, exposure to US Fed policy changes, and potential currency mismatches (cite [13], [14], [15])
5. USD and KHR lending operate in somewhat separate segments — urban/formal economy in USD, rural/agricultural in KHR — with different risk profiles (cite [14], [16])

---

## Section 2.5: Gap in Literature

### What to Write

In 1 short paragraph:

Despite extensive research on dollarization in Cambodia and the well-established use of interest rate spreads as risk indicators, **no study has**:

(a) Applied the mean-reverting stochastic framework to Cambodia's interest rate spreads to construct a Credit Risk Index;

(b) Compared credit risk dynamics across the USD and KHR lending segments;

(c) Used Cambodia's dual-currency spread data to build an early warning indicator for financial stability.

This paper addresses all three gaps.

# How to Search Google Scholar Efficiently

## The Strategy

You don't need to find all papers from scratch. Use the **snowball method**:

1. **Start with one key paper** (e.g., Duma 2011 on Cambodia, or Ho & Saunders 1981 on spreads)
2. **Click "Cited by"** underneath it → this shows every paper that referenced it
3. **Sort by relevance or date** → find more recent papers on the same topic
4. **Check the reference list** of any good paper → the papers IT cites are likely foundational ones you should also read

## Exact Search Strings

Copy-paste these into Google Scholar:

**For Section 2.1:**
```
"probability of default" "loss given default" credit risk framework Basel
"expected credit loss" "data limitations" emerging markets
IFRS 9 "expected credit loss" implementation challenges developing
```

**For Section 2.2:**
```
"net interest margin" OR "interest rate spread" determinants "credit risk"
"bank interest margin" default risk empirical
"early warning" "banking crisis" financial indicators
"credit spread" "financial stability" monitoring
```

**For Section 2.3:**
```
Vasicek 1977 "equilibrium characterization" "term structure"
"Ornstein-Uhlenbeck" interest rate "mean reverting" finance
"mean reversion" "interest rate" stochastic model estimation
```

**For Section 2.4:**
```
dollarization Cambodia banking financial stability
"National Bank of Cambodia" financial sector risk
Cambodia "de-dollarization" policy banking
Cambodia banking sector "credit risk" OR "financial stability"
```

## Quick Tips

- Use **quotes** around exact phrases: `"interest rate spread"` not just interest rate spread
- Use **OR** to broaden: `"credit risk" OR "default risk"`
- Add **year range** in Google Scholar settings to find recent papers
- **Don't read entire papers** — read the abstract, introduction (last paragraph usually states the contribution), and conclusion. Only read methodology sections of papers that use similar methods to yours.
- **15–20 references is enough** for a personal research project

---

# How Long Should the Literature Review Be?

For a personal project (not a thesis), aim for **3–4 pages**. That's roughly:

- Section 2.1 (Credit Risk Measurement): 1/2 to 3/4 page
- Section 2.2 (Spreads as Risk Indicators): 3/4 to 1 page
- Section 2.3 (Stochastic Models): 1/2 to 3/4 page
- Section 2.4 (Cambodia & Dollarization): 3/4 to 1 page
- Section 2.5 (Gap): 1 short paragraph

The literature review is NOT the star of your paper — the results are. Write enough to show you understand the foundations and justify your approach, then move on.
