# Project Overview

## Title (Working)

**"Credit Risk and Dollarization in Cambodia: A Dual-Currency Analysis Using Interest Rate Spreads (2021–2025)"**

## Research Questions

1. How do credit risk dynamics differ between USD and KHR lending in Cambodia's banking sector?
2. Which currency segment is more sensitive to financial shocks and macroeconomic changes?
3. Can a composite dual-currency Credit Risk Index serve as an effective early warning tool for monitoring financial stability?

## Why This Topic Is Strong

- **Original**: No existing study applies a dual-currency CRI framework to Cambodia
- **Policy-relevant**: Cambodia is actively pursuing de-dollarization — your results speak directly to whether that changes the risk profile
- **Data-feasible**: Uses only publicly available NBC interest rate data (no loan-level data needed)
- **Technically impressive**: Stochastic modeling, comparative analysis, stress testing
- **Interview-ready**: Shows you understand Cambodia's unique banking landscape deeply

## The Big Idea in One Paragraph

Cambodia's banking sector is unique because it operates in two currencies simultaneously — roughly 80% of lending is in USD and 20% in KHR. This means credit risk may behave very differently depending on which currency a loan is denominated in. By modeling the interest rate spread (loan rate minus deposit rate) separately for each currency using a mean-reverting stochastic process, you can construct currency-specific Credit Risk Indices and a system-wide composite index. Comparing how these indices behave over the post-COVID recovery period (2021–2025) reveals whether dollarization amplifies or dampens credit risk, and which segment serves as a better early warning signal.

# Your Data

## What You Have

Monthly interest rate data from the **National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)** covering **December 2021 to December 2025** (approximately 49 monthly observations). The data includes deposit money banks' interest rates on deposits and loans in both KHR and USD.

The NBC reports two versions of each rate:

| Version | What It Measures | Speed of Response |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Weighted Average Rate on **New Amount** | Rates on newly issued loans/deposits that month | Fast — reflects banks' current risk pricing |
| Weighted Average Rate on **Outstanding Amount** | Average rate across all existing loans/deposits | Slow — diluted by legacy rates from prior years |

## Which Data to Use

**Primary analysis: Use "Weighted Average Rate on New Amount"**

For an early warning indicator, you want the series that reacts fastest to changing risk conditions. New amount rates reflect banks' current risk assessment in real time. Outstanding amount rates smooth out and delay the signal — you'd detect a shock months later than it actually hit.

**Robustness check: Also run with "Outstanding Amount"**

In your robustness section, repeat the analysis using outstanding amount rates. If results are qualitatively similar, it validates your approach. If the new amount CRI gives earlier/sharper signals (which it should), that's a finding worth reporting.

## Which Loan and Deposit Types to Use

Your NBC data includes multiple product types. Each has different pricing mechanics:

| Product | Characteristics | Suitable for CRI? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Overdraft | Short-term revolving credit, flexible pricing | No — priced for flexibility, not pure credit risk |
| Credit Card | High rates reflecting convenience + unsecured risk | No — bundled pricing distorts the credit risk signal |
| **Term Loans** | **Standard bank lending, fixed maturity** | **Yes — most representative of credit risk pricing** |
| Other Loans | Mixed category, harder to interpret | No — ambiguous composition |

| Product | Characteristics | Suitable for CRI? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Demand Deposits | Very low rates, priced for liquidity | No — near-zero rates don't reflect credit dynamics |
| Saving Deposits | Low rates, partially liquidity-driven | No — similar issue |
| **Term Deposits** | **Fixed maturity, comparable to term loans** | **Yes — best match for term loan spread** |
| Other Deposits | Mixed category | No — ambiguous |

**Decision: Use Term Loans and Term Deposits for both currencies.**

## Your Four Raw Series (from "New Amount" section)

| Series | Row in NBC Data | Currency |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| $r_{\text{loan},t}^{KHR}$ | Row 14: Term Loans (KHR) | KHR |
| $r_{\text{deposit},t}^{KHR}$ | Row 9: Term Deposits (KHR) | KHR |
| $r_{\text{loan},t}^{USD}$ | Row 26: Term Loans (USD) | USD |
| $r_{\text{deposit},t}^{USD}$ | Row 21: Term Deposits (USD) | USD |

## Your Two Computed Spreads

$$
S_t^{KHR} = r_{\text{Term Loans},t}^{KHR} - r_{\text{Term Deposits},t}^{KHR}
$$

$$
S_t^{USD} = r_{\text{Term Loans},t}^{USD} - r_{\text{Term Deposits},t}^{USD}
$$

## Quick Data Preview (from the image)

Using New Amount rates, here are a few sample values to confirm you're reading the right rows:

**KHR (Dec 2021):**

- Term Loans: 10.18%
- Term Deposits: 4.79%
- Spread: 10.18 − 4.79 = **5.39%**

**USD (Dec 2021):**

- Term Loans: 9.09%
- Term Deposits: 3.98%
- Spread: 9.09 − 3.98 = **5.11%**

## Important Note on Sample Size

Your data covers **~49 monthly observations** (Dec 2021 – Dec 2025). This is a shorter sample than ideal for stochastic modeling, but it is workable for several reasons:

- The OU model has only 3 parameters ($\kappa$, $\theta$, $\sigma$), so 49 observations provide reasonable estimation precision
- Monthly frequency gives enough data points (compared to quarterly which would give only ~16)
- You should acknowledge this as a limitation and discuss how results would be strengthened with longer data
- **Try to find older NBC data**: If the NBC publishes historical statistical bulletins (even going back to 2015 or 2018), adding those observations would significantly strengthen your analysis. Check the NBC website statistical section or their annual reports.

# Paper Structure

Aim for **18–25 pages** total.

## Section 1: Introduction (2–3 pages)

### What to Write

Open with the significance of credit risk in banking, then narrow to Cambodia's specific context. The key tension: Cambodia has a dual-currency banking system, and we don't know whether credit risk behaves the same way in both segments.

### Key Arguments to Make

**Cambodia's banking sector context:**

- Rapid credit growth over the past decade (often 15–25% annually)
- Banking assets have grown to over 180% of GDP
- The sector is a critical engine of economic growth but also a potential source of systemic risk

**The dollarization challenge:**

- Cambodia is one of the most dollarized economies in the world
- Approximately 80% of loans and deposits are in USD
- The NBC has been gradually pushing de-dollarization (higher reserve requirements for USD, promoting KHR use)
- USD and KHR lending carry different risk profiles: KHR loans face additional exchange rate risk, while USD loans create systemic vulnerability to external dollar shocks

**The data gap:**

- Granular loan-level default data is not widely available in Cambodia
- Traditional credit risk models (PD, LGD, EAD) require this data
- Interest rate spreads offer an indirect but powerful alternative — banks embed their risk assessment into the rates they charge

**Your contribution:**

- First study to construct a dual-currency Credit Risk Index for Cambodia
- Uses only publicly available data from NBC
- Provides a practical early warning tool
- Captures the post-COVID recovery period and recent monetary tightening

### How to End the Introduction

State your three research questions clearly, then provide a brief roadmap of the paper.

## Section 2: Literature Review (3–4 pages)

Organize into five themes:

### 2.1 Credit Risk Measurement

Briefly explain the standard approach: banks measure credit risk through three components — Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). Together these determine expected credit losses. Mention that this framework requires loan-level data with observed defaults, which is a constraint in emerging markets like Cambodia.

Reference the principle from credit risk modeling that risk factors differ across segments, so models should be built separately — this directly supports your decision to model USD and KHR separately.

### 2.2 Interest Rate Spreads as Risk Indicators

This is the theoretical foundation. The spread between lending and deposit rates reflects the price of credit risk — when banks perceive more risk, they charge higher loan rates relative to deposit rates. Cover:

- The TED spread (Treasury-Eurodollar spread) as a well-known systemic risk indicator
- Corporate bond spreads as credit risk measures
- Studies using bank-level spreads to assess financial health
- The logic: spreads capture credit risk, operating costs, and profit margin, but changes in spreads over time primarily reflect changes in perceived risk

### 2.3 Stochastic Models in Finance

Introduce the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and why mean-reverting models are appropriate for interest rate spreads. Key references:

- Vasicek (1977) — one of the earliest mean-reverting interest rate models
- Literature on stochastic modeling of credit spreads

### 2.4 Cambodia's Financial System and Dollarization

- Overview of Cambodia's banking sector development
- Studies on dollarization in Cambodia (Menon 2008, Duma 2011, or more recent IMF reports)
- NBC's de-dollarization efforts and their impact
- Any existing studies on financial stability or credit risk in Cambodia

### 2.5 Gap in Literature

No study has: (a) applied the CRI framework to Cambodia, (b) compared credit risk dynamics across USD and KHR segments, or (c) used Cambodia's interest rate spreads to construct an early warning indicator.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Literature Review Strategy
Search Google Scholar for: "interest rate spread credit risk", "dollarization Cambodia banking", "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck credit spread", "financial stability early warning indicator", "Cambodia banking sector risk". Aim for 15–25 references. Focus on abstracts, introductions, and key results.
:::

## Section 3: Methodology (5–6 pages)

### 3.1 Data Selection Rationale

Explain why you chose:

- **New Amount** over Outstanding Amount rates (responsiveness to current conditions)
- **Term Loans** over other loan types (most representative of standard credit pricing)
- **Term Deposits** over other deposit types (best maturity-match with term loans)

This subsection shows methodological rigor — you made deliberate, justified choices rather than blindly using whatever data was available.

### 3.2 Interest Rate Spread Definition

For each currency $c \in \{USD, KHR\}$:

$$
S_t^c = r_{\text{Term Loans},t}^c - r_{\text{Term Deposits},t}^c
$$

This gives you two time series: $S_t^{USD}$ and $S_t^{KHR}$.

**Why model them separately**: USD lending is influenced by global dollar conditions and Fed policy, while KHR lending is more sensitive to domestic monetary policy and exchange rate movements. Just as banks build separate models for different portfolio segments, you build separate CRIs.

### 3.3 The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Model

For each currency $c$, the spread follows a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation:

$$
dS_t^c = \kappa^c(\theta^c - S_t^c)\,dt + \sigma^c\,dW_t^c
$$

| Parameter | Meaning | What to Compare Across Currencies |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------------|
| $\theta^c$ | Long-run average spread | Is the "normal" spread higher for KHR or USD? |
| $\kappa^c$ | Speed of mean reversion | Does one currency recover faster from shocks? |
| $\sigma^c$ | Volatility | Which currency has more volatile spreads? |

The explicit solution:

$$
S_t^c = \theta^c + (S_0^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c t} + \sigma^c \int_0^t e^{-\kappa^c(t-s)}\,dW_s^c
$$

The spread at time $t$ follows a normal distribution:

$$
S_t^c \sim \mathcal{N}\left(m^c(t),\; v^c(t)\right)
$$

where:

$$
m^c(t) = \theta^c + (S_0^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c t}
$$

$$
v^c(t) = \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}\left(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c t}\right)
$$

### 3.4 Parameter Estimation

For discrete monthly observations with interval $\Delta t = 1/12$ (one month), the transition density:

$$
S_{t_{i+1}}^c \mid S_{t_i}^c \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\theta^c + (S_{t_i}^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t},\; \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})\right)
$$

The **log-likelihood function**:

$$
\ell(\kappa^c, \theta^c, \sigma^c) = -\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\ln\left(\frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})\right) - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(S_{t_i}^c - \theta^c - (S_{t_{i-1}}^c - \theta^c)e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t}\right)^2}{2 \cdot \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - e^{-2\kappa^c \Delta t})}
$$

Maximize using `scipy.optimize.minimize` (minimize the *negative* log-likelihood) to get $\hat{\kappa}^c$, $\hat{\theta}^c$, $\hat{\sigma}^c$ for each currency.

::: {.callout-note}
## Cross-Check: AR(1) Regression
The OU process in discrete time is equivalent to an AR(1) model:

$$S_{t+1}^c = a^c + b^c S_t^c + \varepsilon_t^c$$

where $b^c = e^{-\kappa^c \Delta t}$, $a^c = \theta^c(1 - b^c)$, and $\text{Var}(\varepsilon^c) = \frac{(\sigma^c)^2}{2\kappa^c}(1 - (b^c)^2)$.

Run a simple OLS regression of $S_{t+1}$ on $S_t$ and back out the OU parameters. This is a quick way to verify your MLE results and adds credibility.
:::

### 3.5 Crisis Threshold

For each currency, define a critical threshold $S_c^c$ above which the spread signals crisis conditions.

**Primary approach**: Use the **95th percentile** of historical spreads:

$$
S_c^{USD} = \text{Percentile}_{95}(S_t^{USD}), \qquad S_c^{KHR} = \text{Percentile}_{95}(S_t^{KHR})
$$

**Sensitivity analysis**: Also test with the 90th and 99th percentiles.

::: {.callout-important}
## Important
Each currency gets its own threshold because their "normal" spread levels are different. KHR spreads are typically wider than USD spreads (reflecting exchange rate risk premium), so a single absolute threshold would be meaningless.
:::

### 3.6 Crisis Probability

For each currency:

$$
P(S_t^c > S_c^c) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{S_c^c - m^c(t)}{\sqrt{v^c(t)}}\right)
$$

where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

### 3.7 Currency-Specific Credit Risk Indices

For each currency:

$$
\text{CRI}^c = \alpha \cdot \hat{\sigma}^c + \beta \cdot P(S_t^c > S_c^c)
$$

Use $\alpha = \beta = 0.5$ as the baseline (equal weight to volatility and crisis probability). Test sensitivity with alternative weights (e.g., $\alpha = 0.3, \beta = 0.7$ emphasizing crisis probability, or vice versa).

### 3.8 System-Wide Composite CRI

Combine the two currency-specific indices:

$$
\text{CRI}_{\text{System}} = w_{USD} \cdot \text{CRI}^{USD} + w_{KHR} \cdot \text{CRI}^{KHR}
$$

| Weighting Approach | $w_{USD}$ | $w_{KHR}$ | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Loan-share weighted (primary) | ~0.80 | ~0.20 | Reflects actual banking system composition |
| Equal weighted | 0.50 | 0.50 | Gives equal attention to both segments |
| Time-varying | Changes yearly | Changes yearly | Captures de-dollarization trend |

Run all three as a sensitivity analysis. Loan-share weighted is your primary result.

### 3.9 Stress Testing

Apply stress shocks to both currencies:

$$
S_t^{c,\text{stress}} = S_t^c(1 + \delta)
$$

| Scenario | $\delta$ | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Mild | 0.10 | Minor economic slowdown |
| Moderate | 0.30 | Significant financial stress |
| Severe | 0.50 | Major crisis scenario |

Recompute $\text{CRI}^{USD}$, $\text{CRI}^{KHR}$, and $\text{CRI}_{\text{System}}$ under each stress scenario. Compare to baseline.

**Key question**: Is the USD segment or KHR segment more fragile under stress? This has direct implications for de-dollarization policy.

### 3.10 Rolling Window Analysis

Since your sample period is ~4 years, instead of a simple sub-period split, use a **rolling window approach** to track how risk evolves over time:

- Use a 12-month rolling window to re-estimate OU parameters monthly
- This produces a time series of $\hat{\kappa}_t$, $\hat{\theta}_t$, $\hat{\sigma}_t$ for each currency
- Plot these to show how the risk dynamics change over your sample period

This approach is better than splitting a 4-year sample into sub-periods (which would give too few observations per period).

::: {.callout-note}
## Why Rolling Window Instead of Sub-Period Split
The previous roadmap suggested splitting data into pre-COVID / COVID / post-COVID periods. With data starting in Dec 2021, you're already in the post-COVID recovery period. A rolling window captures the gradual evolution of risk without requiring arbitrary cut points, and it works better with shorter samples.

However, you can still annotate key events on your charts:

- **2022**: Global monetary tightening (Fed rate hikes affecting USD lending)
- **2023**: Cambodia's post-COVID recovery acceleration
- **2024–2025**: Recent developments in NBC policy and banking sector

### 3.11 Robustness Checks

Summarize all the sensitivity analyses in one subsection:

| Check | What You Vary | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Outstanding Amount rates | Data source | Confirm results hold with alternative rate measure |
| 90th / 99th percentile thresholds | Crisis threshold | Show CRI is not sensitive to threshold choice |
| Alternative CRI weights | $\alpha$, $\beta$ values | Show CRI ranking is stable across weight schemes |
| Equal vs. loan-share system weights | $w_{USD}$, $w_{KHR}$ | Show system CRI is robust to weighting |
| Alternative loan types (Overdraft) | Product used for spread | Confirm term loans give the cleanest signal |

---

## Section 4: Data Description (2–3 pages)

### 4.1 Data Source

- **Source**: National Bank of Cambodia, Deposit Money Banks' Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans
- **Period**: December 2021 – December 2025 (49 monthly observations)
- **Rate type**: Weighted Average Rate on New Amount (primary); Outstanding Amount (robustness)
- **Products used**: Term Loans and Term Deposits
- **Currencies**: KHR and USD
- **Coverage**: Including commercial banks and specialized banks

### 4.2 Data Selection Justification

Explain clearly (this shows methodological rigor):

**Why New Amount rates**: New amount rates capture banks' current risk pricing. When a bank perceives rising credit risk, it immediately raises rates on new loans. Outstanding amount rates are diluted by legacy loans issued months or years earlier, making them slow to respond. For an early warning indicator, responsiveness is essential.

**Why Term Loans and Term Deposits**: Term loans are the most standard lending product — they have a fixed maturity and their pricing most directly reflects credit risk assessment. Overdrafts are priced for flexibility, credit cards bundle convenience premiums, and "other loans" is an ambiguous category. Similarly, term deposits are the best maturity match for term loans, avoiding the liquidity-driven pricing of demand and saving deposits.

### 4.3 Computed Spreads

| Variable | Formula | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| $S_t^{KHR}$ | $r_{\text{Term Loans},t}^{KHR} - r_{\text{Term Deposits},t}^{KHR}$ | Credit risk compensation in riel lending |
| $S_t^{USD}$ | $r_{\text{Term Loans},t}^{USD} - r_{\text{Term Deposits},t}^{USD}$ | Credit risk compensation in dollar lending |

### 4.4 Descriptive Statistics

| Statistic | $S_t^{USD}$ | $S_t^{KHR}$ |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Mean | ? | ? |
| Std. Dev. | ? | ? |
| Min | ? | ? |
| Max | ? | ? |
| Skewness | ? | ? |
| Percentile 5th | ? | ? |
| Percentile 95th | ? | ? |
| Observations | 49 | 49 |

### 4.5 Key Visualizations for This Section

1. **Dual time series plot**: Both $S_t^{USD}$ and $S_t^{KHR}$ on the same chart, with key events annotated (e.g., Fed rate hikes 2022, Cambodia banking sector developments)
2. **Histograms**: Distribution of each spread — are they approximately normal?
3. **Scatter plot / correlation**: How correlated are the two spread series? Do they move together or independently?
4. **Raw rate plot**: Show the four underlying rates (loan and deposit for each currency) so readers can see what's driving the spread

### 4.6 Supplementary Data (Optional but Helpful)

| Data | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Share of USD vs. KHR lending | NBC Annual Reports | System CRI weights |
| GDP growth rate | World Bank / NBC | Annotate charts with economic context |
| NPL ratios | NBC / IMF reports | Cross-validate CRI against actual default trends |
| USD/KHR exchange rate | NBC | Context for KHR spread movements |

---

## Section 5: Results (5–6 pages)

### 5.1 Spread Dynamics: Visual Overview

Before diving into the model, describe what the raw spread data shows:

- Is there a clear trend? (Are spreads narrowing or widening over 2021–2025?)
- Which spread is larger — KHR or USD? (KHR should be higher due to exchange rate risk premium)
- Do they move together? (High correlation = common shocks; low correlation = different risk drivers)
- Are there visible structural breaks or sudden jumps?

### 5.2 Estimated OU Parameters

| Parameter | USD | KHR | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----|-----|----------------|
| $\hat{\theta}$ | ? | ? | Long-run "normal" spread level |
| $\hat{\kappa}$ | ? | ? | Speed of recovery after shocks (higher = faster) |
| $\hat{\sigma}$ | ? | ? | Spread volatility (higher = more unstable) |

**Key comparisons to discuss:**

- Is $\theta^{KHR} > \theta^{USD}$? (Expected — KHR loans carry exchange rate risk premium)
- Is $\kappa^{KHR}$ higher or lower than $\kappa^{USD}$? (If lower, KHR spreads are more persistent after shocks)
- Is $\sigma^{KHR} > \sigma^{USD}$? (If so, the KHR segment is inherently more volatile)

Also present the AR(1) cross-check results to validate your MLE estimates.

### 5.3 Crisis Probability Over Time

Plot $P(S_t^{USD} > S_c^{USD})$ and $P(S_t^{KHR} > S_c^{KHR})$ over time on the same chart. Annotate key events:

- 2022: Fed rate hikes and global monetary tightening
- 2023: Cambodia's recovery and NBC policy changes
- 2024–2025: Recent trends

**Key question**: Which currency's crisis probability fluctuates more? Do they spike at the same times?

### 5.4 Currency-Specific CRIs

Plot $\text{CRI}^{USD}$ and $\text{CRI}^{KHR}$ over time. Interpret using:

| CRI Level | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Low | Stable financial conditions |
| Moderate | Elevated risk — increased monitoring warranted |
| High | Severe danger — potential crisis |

*(Calibrate these thresholds based on your actual results)*

### 5.5 System-Wide Composite CRI

Plot $\text{CRI}_{\text{System}}$ alongside the individual currency CRIs. Discuss:

- Does the composite give a clearer or muddier signal?
- Are there periods where one currency's CRI is high but the system CRI stays moderate (because the other segment is stable)?

### 5.6 Rolling Window Parameter Evolution

Plot how $\hat{\kappa}_t$, $\hat{\theta}_t$, $\hat{\sigma}_t$ change over time for each currency using the 12-month rolling window. This shows:

- Is the banking sector becoming more or less stable?
- Are USD and KHR risk dynamics converging or diverging?
- Are there periods where volatility suddenly increases?

### 5.7 Stress Test Results

| Scenario | $\text{CRI}^{USD}$ | $\text{CRI}^{KHR}$ | $\text{CRI}_{\text{System}}$ | Δ from Baseline |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Baseline | ? | ? | ? | — |
| Mild ($\delta=0.1$) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Moderate ($\delta=0.3$) | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Severe ($\delta=0.5$) | ? | ? | ? | ? |

**Key question**: Which currency's CRI is more sensitive to stress? If USD jumps more, the dominant 80% of banking is fragile. If KHR is more sensitive, it supports cautious de-dollarization.

### 5.8 Robustness Check Summary

Present a compact table showing that your main findings hold under alternative specifications:

| Robustness Check | Main Finding Holds? | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Outstanding Amount rates | ? | CRI levels differ but ranking same? |
| 90th percentile threshold | ? | Similar pattern? |
| 99th percentile threshold | ? | Similar pattern? |
| Equal system weights | ? | Materially different from loan-share? |
| Alternative CRI weights ($\alpha=0.3, \beta=0.7$) | ? | Ranking preserved? |

---

## Section 6: Discussion (2–3 pages)

### 6.1 Key Findings

Interpret your results in terms of:

- **Dollarization and risk**: Does the USD segment behave as a stabilizer or a vulnerability? The comparison of $\text{CRI}^{USD}$ vs. $\text{CRI}^{KHR}$ is your headline finding.
- **Risk evolution**: Based on the rolling window, is Cambodia's banking sector becoming more or less risky over 2021–2025?
- **Early warning value**: Does the CRI pick up rising risk before it becomes obvious in other indicators?

### 6.2 Policy Implications

- **For the NBC**: The dual-currency CRI could be a practical monitoring tool requiring only data the NBC already publishes
- **For de-dollarization**: If the KHR segment shows lower crisis sensitivity, it supports the agenda. If opposite, transition needs careful management
- **For banks**: Understanding which currency is more volatile helps with internal risk management, pricing, and capital allocation

### 6.3 Limitations

Be honest — this shows academic maturity:

- **Sample size**: ~49 monthly observations is workable but not abundant. Results should be validated as more data becomes available.
- **Post-COVID only**: The data starts in late 2021, so you don't observe the initial COVID shock. Results reflect the recovery period rather than a full crisis cycle.
- **Spreads capture more than credit risk**: Operating costs and profit margins are embedded. Changes in spreads don't purely reflect credit risk.
- **Aggregate data**: NBC rates are market averages across all banks. Individual banks may behave differently.
- **Model assumptions**: The OU model assumes normally distributed shocks and constant parameters (within each estimation window). Reality may include jumps and regime changes.
- **No direct validation**: Without loan-level default data, you can't directly validate CRI against actual defaults.

### 6.4 Future Research

- Extend with longer historical data as it becomes available
- Apply to individual bank-level data if accessible
- Add macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, exchange rate, inflation) to enrich the model
- Compare Cambodia's CRI to neighboring ASEAN economies (Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar)
- Test alternative stochastic models (e.g., jump-diffusion for sudden shocks)
- Incorporate the NBC's loan classification data to validate CRI against NPL trends

# Interview Preparation

## The 60-Second Pitch

> "I built a dual-currency Credit Risk Index for Cambodia's banking sector. Cambodia is heavily dollarized — about 80% of lending is in US dollars — so I wanted to understand whether credit risk behaves differently in the dollar segment versus the riel segment. I used four years of monthly interest rate data from the National Bank of Cambodia, specifically weighted average rates on new term loans and term deposits. I chose new amount rates over outstanding amount rates because they respond faster to changes in risk perception, which is critical for an early warning tool. I modeled the lending-deposit spread for each currency using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process, estimated crisis probabilities, and constructed three indices: a USD-specific CRI, a KHR-specific CRI, and a loan-share-weighted system composite. I also ran stress tests under mild, moderate, and severe scenarios, and used a rolling window to track how risk parameters evolve over time. The framework gives regulators and banks a practical monitoring tool that works without needing loan-level default data."

## Likely Follow-Up Questions

**"Why did you use interest rate spreads instead of default data?"**
> Cambodia doesn't have widely available loan-level default data. The spread approach captures how banks price risk in real time using only publicly available data. It's an indirect measure — when banks perceive higher credit risk, they widen spreads on new loans.

**"Why new amount rates specifically?"**
> Outstanding amount rates average across all existing loans, including ones issued years ago. They're slow to react. New amount rates reflect what banks are charging right now — if risk perception changes today, it shows up in today's new loan rates, not diluted by legacy positions.

**"Why term loans and term deposits?"**
> Term loans are the most standard lending product — their pricing most directly reflects credit risk. Overdrafts are priced for flexibility, credit cards bundle convenience premiums. Similarly, term deposits are the best maturity match, avoiding the liquidity-driven pricing of demand deposits.

**"What's the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model?"**
> A mean-reverting stochastic process. It captures the idea that spreads don't wander randomly — they tend to return to a normal level driven by competition and monetary policy. Three intuitive parameters: long-run average, speed of reversion, and volatility.

**"Is 4 years of data enough?"**
> It's a limitation I acknowledge. The OU model has only three parameters, so 49 observations provide reasonable estimates. I validated with AR(1) regression as a cross-check and used rolling windows rather than sub-period splits to make the most of the available data. Extending with older data would strengthen the analysis.

**"What were your main findings?"**
> [Depends on results — frame as a comparison story between USD and KHR segments]

**"What are the limitations?"**
> Three main ones: the spread captures operating costs and margins, not just credit risk; I'm working with aggregate market rates, not individual bank data; and the sample covers the post-COVID period, so I don't observe the initial shock itself.

# Next Steps: What to Do Right Now

1. **Format your NBC data** into a clean CSV with columns: `date`, `term_loan_khr`, `term_deposit_khr`, `term_loan_usd`, `term_deposit_usd` (from the "New Amount" section, rows 9, 14, 21, 26)
2. **Check for older data**: Look on the NBC website for historical statistical bulletins going back further than Dec 2021 — more data points = stronger analysis
3. **Find USD/KHR lending shares** from any recent NBC annual report (for system CRI weights)
4. **Install Anaconda** and open Jupyter Notebook
5. **Plot both spreads** — just seeing the data visually will give you immediate intuition about whether KHR and USD risk move together or apart
6. **Come back to me** when ready to code — I will help you build each notebook step by step, starting with data preparation and parameter estimation
