This gap reflects the **exchange rate risk premium** embedded in riel-denominated lending — borrowers taking KHR loans face currency depreciation risk, and banks compensate with wider margins.

The negative kurtosis for KHR (−1.12) indicates a **platykurtic** distribution — fat but spread out, without the extreme tails one might expect.

This asymmetry arises because the USD spread spent most of the post-2018 period at lower levels (4–6%) but had higher values in the early sample (2013–2016).
